Use either joystick to move around and dodge enemies, and tap/hold on the screen to fire in the direction of the tap. You are the last hope for the Wii U homebrew scene!\nI had a lot of fun making this game and I hope you all enjoy my little generic space shooter homebrew! I love how the homebrew scene is starting to take off.",
